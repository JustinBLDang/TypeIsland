## Overview
### Description
Singleplayer speed-typing based game. Complete typing-based challenges to combat monsters and unlock rewards.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Game
- **Mobile:** This app would work on a computer but would be a completely different experience due to the change in keyboard. 
- **Story:** The user will "battle" to earn gold to unlock features for their home island. The battle will consist of the user completing typing-related challenges to progress through the endless level, earning more gold the longer they survive.
- **Market:** Anyone and everyone.
- **Habit:** While it may be addictive in the short term as they battle new monsters and unlock new features, there will be a point at which they reach an end and there is no current reason to replay.
- **Scope:** We will start with a single game mode and limited features for purchase. We may add other game modes and multiplayer functionality in the future.
